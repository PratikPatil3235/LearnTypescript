üìù Task: Build a simple Library System
You will create a class hierarchy with Book as base and EBook as a derived class. You will practice access modifiers, inheritance, static properties, and getters/setters.

Task Description
Create a Book class with:

private properties: title (string), author (string)

protected property: price (number)

public readonly property: isbn (string)

static property: libraryName (string) ‚Äî same for all books

constructor to initialize the above properties

a public method getDetails() that returns a string combining title, author, price, and isbn.

getters and setters for price (setter should only allow positive numbers, otherwise throw an error)

Create a subclass EBook that extends Book:

additional private property: fileSizeMB (number)

constructor should initialize all properties including parent class

override getDetails() method to add file size information

add a public method download() that returns a string "Downloading [title]"

Test your classes by:

Creating at least one Book and one EBook instance

Try accessing private and protected properties from outside and inside the class to see what works and what throws errors

Use getters and setters for the price

Log the results of getDetails() and download() for the EBook

Access the static property libraryName without creating an instance
