1) If we declare any veriable of perticular type we can only re-initialize that veriable with only that perticular type and not with any other type
2)only type any can be used to re-initialize to any value but not re-commended
3)In a  single project with typescript we can only declare any veriable only once and not many times

🆚 Differences Between Type Alias and Interface


                                Feature	interface	                            type

Object type definition	    ✅ Yes	                                ✅ Yes

Extending other types	    ✅ extends keyword	                    ✅ & intersection

Declaration merging	        ✅ Supported	                            ❌ Not supported

Use with primitives	        ❌ Not allowed	                        ✅ Allowed (`type ID = string)

Readability in tooling	    ✅ Better in IDEs/auto-docs	            👍 Still good

Preferred when	            Creating reusable object contracts	      Combining types, primitives, unions, tuples



Implecite vs explicite typing 

Implecite

let name = "Alice"; // inferred as string
let age = 30;       // inferred as number

Explicite

let name: string = "Alice";
let age: number = 30;


commands we must know 
npm install lodash                                           install in dependencies
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash                         install and saved in dev dependencies
